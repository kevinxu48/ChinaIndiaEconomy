# Conclusion
### Idk what to say Im sure u can make this better; need to include main takeaways of your exploration, limitations, future directions, lessons learned
From our research and plots we can conclude that both China and India have had a growing economy since the the year 2000 that has not slowed down even after the Coronavirus insurgence. China has always had a faster growing economy, but in recent years India has began to outpace China in terms of GDP growth and even population. Moreover, the rapid economic growth of these two countries has come at the price of environmental damage, which can be visualized through their sources of energy usage that contribute to high CO2 emissions and low Gain index. However, both countries are steadily improving in their resilience to environmental damage, but are still significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. From our current research and data cannot conclude whether India will surpass China economically in the near or distant future because we cannot extrapolate our current plots to predict the trend in the years come. From the data, we have discovered that many data sets are not in a usable form for plotting; it is also important to know how to deal with missing values because had we not been lucky. We also learned that we should not approach data analysis with an initial bias and a conclusion already formulated. For instance, when analyzing the ND-Gain index scores, we expected China to be significantly less resilient to environmental impacts, but its ND-Gain index was actually high since 2006. Moreover, we expected the GDP growth heatmap to be more conclusive, but it is difficult to determine which economy has been growing faster since 2010 because both countries have had increasing GDP growth with no clear winner.
