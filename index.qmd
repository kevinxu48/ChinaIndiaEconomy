Historically, China has had the largest economic growth since the late 1900's. However, there has been discussion among pundits regarding whether India's economic growth will outpace China. We decided to explore this conversation in depth. The main question we would like to propose is: will India's economic growth outpace China's in the near or distant future? We would like to analyze how historical trends are progressing/changing and contextualizing these patterns to theorize what is to come for the two countries over the next few decades. For instance, the potential conflicts the two countries will face, effects of climate change, and the influence of technology. There are many factors to consider when analyzing a country's economic growth; some for instance are gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, inflation rate, trade balance, currency exchange rates, consumer spending, government debt, investment spending, housing market, education levels, etc.
